# PlayingAroundPyhton
Playing around with python, trying to learn new ways of programming styles, hopefully getting to a higher lever

This will contain two seperate branches, the Python branch and Master

Python branch -> Will contain the fundamentals around python and some testing around some cases

Master branch -> Will contain some projects that over time I will start developing
